# PDF Ref Preview

A bookmarklet is a link that contains Javascript. To install a bookmarklet, the most common way is to drag and drop a bookmarklet link into your browser's bookmark bar.

This bookmarklet only works if the viewer uses [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/), which is the default in Firefox. In Chrome, it is possible to switch the PDF viewer using extensions, but this tool is not tested there.
